# Demo: Vue.js: Working with APIs
This demo project will help you understand how to access and use different APIs using Vue.js. Learn how to build a simple music player using the HTML audio element and libraries like Bootstrap and Font Awesome â€“ which both come with their own APIs. The project also shows how to work with local and remote data with the Fetch, Axios and Vuex APIs, and integrate Google Firebase for real-time multi-user features.
